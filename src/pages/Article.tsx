          From Register to Real-Time: How Modern Housing Societies Run Without Paper
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Managing a housing society in India has always meant juggling six different problems at once —
          who is at the gate, who has paid maintenance, whether the clubhouse is free on Sunday, where
          the housekeeping staff is, whether that Zomato agent was actually let in, and what the maid's
          attendance looks like this month. For decades, the answer to all of these was some combination
          of a register, a phone call, and a committee member's memory. There is a better way.

            Every feature in VisitorPasses was built from a real friction point that a real housing society
            faces every day. The platform started at the gate because that is the most visible problem.
            It grew to cover deliveries, staff attendance, house help tracking, maintenance collection,
            and amenity bookings — because each of these is its own daily source of wasted time, missed
            information, and avoidable frustration.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            The goal is not to digitise the register. It is to make the register — and the maintenance
            spreadsheet, and the booking WhatsApp group, and the attendance notebook — unnecessary.
            And to give residents, guards, and committee members back the hours and peace of mind that
            the old system was quietly taking from them every single day.
